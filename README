                                   digcircuit

A simulation of digital circuits.

The basic building blocks for this simulation are logic gates, such as and, or,
and not. By combining these gates in various patterns and then applying a set of
input values, we can build circuits that have logical functions.

Please refer to the files in doc/ for more details of how to use the modules.
